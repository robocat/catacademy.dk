          team of very talented people and we've learned a lot doing
          this. We are launching Cat Academy, an initiative to share
          our experience and knowledge with you through honest and

            markdown:
              Most products these days, even the simplest apps
              need some measure of back-end development.
              More and more people are learning the desing and
              front-end tools to create the products of their
              dreams but back-end development remains one of
              the trickier aspects of the process. We'd like to
              help you with that.

              During the two-day course you will develop a
              small API server for a turn-based multiplayer
              game. You will learn to use the following
              technologies and tools:

                * Python programming language,
                * Flask–web micro-framework,
                * SQLAlchemy—object-relational mapping library,
                * Heroku—app-hosting platform.

              You will not become an expert in these technologies,
              but you will learn enough to be able to use them to
              create simple API servers, and be prepated enough to
              be able to study further on your own.

              Here are the things that are necessary to know in before joining
              this course:

               * programming in an *object-oriented* style, in a language such
               * as
                 JavaScript, Objective-C, Java, C# or other;
               * *version-control* systems, such as
                 Subversion, Mercurial or Git;
               * *SQL* and relational databases,
               * *Unix* operating system (e.g. OS X or Linux) and its *shell*.

              You will need to bring a laptop with <abbr>OS X</abbr> or Linux
              operating system installed. If you have Windows you can use
              [VirtualBox](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox) to
              install Linux alongside Windows in a sandbox environment.  But
              remember that you still need basic knowledge of Unix and shell.

              Unlike the title suggests, you do not need to be a front-end
              developer to join this course.

              ### Concept & Pricing

              Cat Academy is a new crowdfunded approach to learning. We've
              learned so much and we want to be able to organize courses,
              workshops and talks that benefit you. This is why we've taken a
              crowdfunded approach to ticket sales—a minumum amount of 5
              seats needs to be reserved for the event ot go forward.

              We're aiming for very compact, hands-on events that will help
              you get familiar with awesome subjects and leave you thirsty
              for more
