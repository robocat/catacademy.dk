      Creating that one, singular piece of graphic design
      that users will interact with first each time they
      see your or your client's product can be an
      intimidating task. A beautiful, identifiable and
      memorable app icon can have a huge impact on
      the popularity and success of an app. But how
      exactly does one make a 'good' app icon? what
      does that even mean? We'd like to help you with
      that.

      ### Concept & Pricing

      Cat Academy is a new crowdfunded approach to learning. We've
      learned so much and we want to be able to organize courses,
      workshops and talks that benefit you. This is why we've taken a
      crowdfunded approach to ticket sales—a minimum amount of 5
      seats needs to be reserved for the event to go forward.

      We're aiming for very compact, hands-on events that will help
      you get familiar with awesome subjects and leave you thirsty
      for more
