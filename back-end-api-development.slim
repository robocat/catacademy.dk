      "Help! My App Needs a Back-end!"

  .copy
    markdown:
      Most products these days, even the simplest apps
      need some measure of back-end development.
      More and more people are learning the design and
      front-end tools to create the products of their
      dreams but back-end development remains one of
      the trickier aspects of the process. We'd like to
      help you with that.

  .copy
    markdown:
      During the two-day course you will develop a
      small API server for a turn-based multiplayer
      game. You will learn to use the following
      technologies and tools:

        * Python programming language,
        * Flask–web micro-framework,
        * SQLAlchemy—object-relational mapping library,
        * Heroku—app-hosting platform.

      You will not become an expert in these technologies,
      but you will learn enough to be able to use them to
      create simple API servers, and be prepared enough to
      be able to study further on your own.

  h3 Prerequisites

    markdown:
      Here are the things that are necessary to know in before joining
      this course:

       * programming in an *object-oriented* style, in a language such
         as
         JavaScript, Objective-C, Java, C# or other;
       * *version-control* systems, such as
         Subversion, Mercurial or Git;
       * *SQL* and relational databases,
       * *Unix* operating system (e.g. OS X or Linux) and its *shell*.

      You will need to bring a laptop with <abbr>OS X</abbr> or Linux
      operating system installed. If you have Windows you can use
      [VirtualBox](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox) to
      install Linux alongside Windows in a sandbox environment.  But
      remember that you still need basic knowledge of Unix and shell.

      *Unlike the title suggests, you do not need to be a front-end
      developer to join this course.*

      ### Concept & Pricing

      Cat Academy is a new crowdfunded approach to learning. We've
      learned so much and we want to be able to organize courses,
      workshops and talks that benefit you. This is why we've taken a
      crowdfunded approach to ticket sales—a minimum amount of 5
      seats needs to be reserved for the event to go forward.

      We're aiming for very compact, hands-on events that will help
      you get familiar with awesome subjects and leave you thirsty
      for more
