</p><h1>Back-end API developement for front-end developers</h1><a class="buy-ticket" href="#">Buy Ticket</a><p>from DKK 3,141.–</p></div><div class="description"><div class="quote"><p>&ldquo;Help! My App Needs a Back-end!&rdquo;</p>
</div><div class="copy"><p>Most products these days, even the simplest apps
need some measure of back-end development.
More and more people are learning the desing and
front-end tools to create the products of their
dreams but back-end development remains one of
the trickier aspects of the process. We&rsquo;d like to
help you with that.</p>
</div></div><div class="what-you-learn"><h3>What you&rsquo;ll learn</h3><div class="copy"><p>During the two-day course you will develop a
small API server for a turn-based multiplayer
game. You will learn to use the following
technologies and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python programming language,</li>
<li>Flask–web micro-framework,</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy—object-relational mapping library,</li>
<li>Heroku—app-hosting platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not become an expert in these technologies,
but you will learn enough to be able to use them to
create simple API servers, and be prepated enough to
be able to study further on your own.</p>
